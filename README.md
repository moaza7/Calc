# Calc ‚ûï‚ûñ

This repository contains a standard mathematical calculator programmed in Java. The program accepts a mathematical expression from the user which it then solves. Using the idea of queues, the main method uses two of them to distinguish operands and operators and then computes the result. This program is a great way to learn how to work with queues and linkedlists. Some of the concepts a developer may need to be familiar with include:
- Scanner Input/Output
- Queue Data Structure
- Type Conversion
- Static Methods

__Note__: This program will only work if the corresponding 'WQueue' is placed in the same package alongside it.
